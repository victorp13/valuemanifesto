<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manifesto for Value Delivery</h3>

<p>The Value Manifesto is a short essay on how the tech industry should relentlessly focus on the value it delivers. Specifically, it tries to teach engineers why great development teams succeed in the marketplace by focusing on delivering value, and value only.There are of course many more factors that can contribute to the success of an engineering team. But value - be it monetary or otherwise - is oft overlooked, and this writing aims to change just that. </p>

<p>The title of course is a tongue-in-cheek reference to The Agile Manifesto - a document that fundamentally changed the way we looked at the engineering process itself. I regard this Value Manifesto as an appendix to that document. The success of agile methodology is always measured in the value it delivers. Value, in a way, both precedes as well as becomes the result of working in an agile fashion.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> over Release Management</li>
<li><strong>User friendly</strong> over developer friendly</li>
<li><strong>Delivering fixes</strong> over delivering features</li>
<li><strong>Usability studies</strong> over tech-driven optimization</li>
</ul>
</pre>

<a id="about-value" class="anchor" href="#about-value" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is value?</h3>

<p>Value is the result of a human being subjectively perceiving and comparing a product or service. That may sound vague or complex, but the term ‘subjectively’ is deliberately chosen here. Value is mostly a matter of taste, relativity, or even timeliness. We try to express value in monetary terms in order to simplify value comparison processes. But the fact of the matter is that human beings are terrible at judging monetary value based on mostly non-monetary data. </p>

<p>I am lucky enough to work in a digital agency, where personal preference in design, interaction and messages are not just a staple, but the very cornerstone of our business. Our customers usually come to us with requests for hard monetary improvements. And on the offset they may specify their goals very concretely in words such as “improved exposure”, “higher conversion” or “repeat sales”. Yet as soon as we go into the business of defining the steps to reach those hard goals, we go down a path of subjective discover of what their end users value.</p>
        <h3>
<a id="about-people" class="anchor" href="#about-people" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do people value?</h3>

<p>Even though I am an engineer at heart, I choose economics as my field of study. My reasoning was that since I could teach myself how to run code, I would spend my university years better by being taught how the world itself was run. What I learned in all those years going through classics such as Drucker, Smith, or even Marx, was that even when it comes to expressing ourselves purely in monetary terms, we simply have no clue what we’re valuing. </p>

<p>It was kind of a sobering conclusion, that helped me a lot over the years when building startups and growing engineerings teams the world over. When it comes to decision making, you more often than not are outright failing to see what the future return will be on investments made today. So when our customers come to us with a problem, they entrust us, and they do not do this lightheartedly. But they also are not sure that we will get a return on their investment.

<p>The same goes for site visitors and end users of software. They too spend time with our products now in order to save either time, effort or money at a later date. For them too, the value they get out of using your product or service is hard to define. Mostly it will be completely subjective. Users cannot make hard measurements as to whether a competitive product would have given them more value, or less. But they for sure value the time they invested.</p>
